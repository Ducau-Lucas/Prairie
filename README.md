Currently you can observe 8 different drones going back and forth toward their delivery targets and coming from 4 storage facilities around Pau.

You can also click on the map to add new delivery markers.

When clicking on the map and adding a new delivery target, a new drone will immediately depart from the nearest storage facility toward the new delivery target.
